[W] onnx2trt_utils.cpp:377: Your ONNX model has been generated with INT64 weights, while TensorRT does not natively support INT64. Attempting to cast down to INT32.
[W] Tensor DataType is determined at build time for tensors not marked as input or output.
[W] Input tensor: tensorX (dtype=DataType.FLOAT, shape=(-1, 1, 28, 28)) | No shapes provided; Will use shape: [1, 1, 28, 28] for min/opt/max in profile.
[W] This will cause the tensor to have a static shape. If this is incorrect, please set the range of shapes for this input tensor.
[I] Configuring with profiles:[
